**BINARY ARCHITECTURE**
note: "block = a chunk of bytes with an allocated size"

block #     block               type                            purpose
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
--          version             uint32_t                    version # of the file
--          blocks              uint32_t                    counts the number of blocks (not including blocks 0-2)
--          block sizes         multiple uint32_t's         counts the number of all neural network weight/bias blocks.
--          config size         uint32_t                    counts the number of all the blocks of configuration data. (**MUST** BE uint32_t)

|             config data 2     uint32_t

0           1 x bias layer      1 float 32 for each bias        holds the biases, there can be as many of these as needed
1           1 x weight layer    1 float 32 for each weight      holds the weights, there can be as many of these as needed
2           1 x bias layer      1 float 32 for each bias        holds the biases
3           1 x weight layer    1 float 32 for each weight      holds the weights
...

        
keep weights on every odd block number, and biases on every even block number
